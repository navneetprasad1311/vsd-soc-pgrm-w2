# *Week 2* VSD RISCâ€‘V Tapeout Program ![BabySoC](https://img.shields.io/badge/SoC_Research_%26_Hands_On-Done-darkgreen)

`28/09/2025` to `04/10/2025`


## Objectives

- Review RVMYTH CPU instruction set and verify all basic arithmetic, logic, and control instructions.
- Simulate CPU-memory-peripheral interactions using Verilog testbenches.
- Analyze waveform outputs with GTKWave to validate data flow.
- Begin pre-tapeout steps, including timing constraints and synthesis checks.
- Document and log all simulation results for functional verification.
