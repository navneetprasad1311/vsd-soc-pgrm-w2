## Objectives

- Develop a solid understanding of VSDBabySoC fundamentals, including its CPU, memory, and peripheral architecture.

- Gain hands-on experience with functional modeling of the BabySoC using Verilog.

- Simulate and verify SoC behavior using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

- Understand the workflow from instruction execution to DAC output and waveform analysis.

- Prepare for pre-tapeout steps, including timing verification, synthesis checks, and netlist preparation.
